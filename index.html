        <p class="section-paragraph">My name is Ahmad Umaer Mohamad, a software programmer. I graduated from SM Sains Sultan Mahmud for High School and continue to pursue my study in Electrical Engineering in Multimedia University. I have an
          experience working as Project Engineer for 3 years. If you're looking for a <em>Software Programmer</em>, <em>Data Analyst</em>, or <em>Web Based Application Developer</em>, you're coming to the right place. My area of coverage of job
          including development of software for Machine Vision application, deep Learning program, database application, web application, electrical design and wiring, electronics and mechanical assembling.</p>

        <h1 class="section-title">MY STUDIES</h1>
        <p class="section-paragraph">In Highschool, I attended SM Sains Sultan Mahmud from 2011 to 2012 where I have Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) at the end of my studies. My studies is focussed on the Science Stream where I have strong fundemental
          in physics and mathematics. After graduated from high school I worked at brick making factory where I learn about preserverence, hard work and mental strength. Next, I attended Multimedia from 2013 to 2019 for Foundation and also Bachelor
          in Electrical Engineering. Here I learn all the basics of <em>electrical</em>, <em>electronics</em>, <em>programming</em> and <em>physics</em>. At the final year of the studies I did the final year project about the soil resistivity
          calculation. For the project I study on the different method of doing the grounding system, soil type, depth of the soil, and water content of the soil. Taking into account of all of that, I simulate a program to calculate a soil
          resistivity based on the parameters from the user. Later I landed on the Project Engineer job where I involved in the development of the project for Machine Vision and Control Automation at Control Easy Technology. I'm more orientated
          towards the software programming where I create a program for Image Processing, database and UI development.</p>

        <h1 class="section-title">PROGRAMMING & SOFT SKILLS</h1>
        <p class="section-paragraph">In Multimedia University, I did a project about <em>NFC Technology</em> as learning station where i develop the program using <em>Python</em>, <em>Javascript</em>, and <em>Java</em>. The program is develop on the
          Raspberry Pi with NFC tags and mobile application as a controlling device I also develop the soil resistivity calculation program using <em>Microsoft Excel</em> for my final year project. At the beginning of my career in Control Easy
          Technology. I learned on the fundamentals of <em>Automation</em> and <em>Machine Vision</em> system. Most of my Machine Vision project is using C#.NET, C++ and VB.NET as a development language. One of the high end program I developed is the
          Deep Learning Program on recognizing different pattern, shapes and defects on an objects. I also work on a project for Warehouse Management System using VB.NET and MySQL as a database. Other than that I have experience on few projects using
          Python for Facial Recognition program. Other than that is the <em>Electrical Design </em>, Wiring and Excel Macros for keeping the data on Machine Vision Inspection.</p>
